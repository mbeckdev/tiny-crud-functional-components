A tiny CRUD task list - code to help remember Hooks with functional components in React

CRUD = Create, Read, Update, and Delete

## Why

- To practice using Hooks in React

## Notes

- Functional components are cool. useState lets you use state in React without class components!
- I tried using useEffect just to try them out but couldn't figure out a good use for them in this app. I set one up that gives a console.log message when one state changes and then I commented it out. Maybe if I used an API it would be more useful.


- There are two extra class components inside of App.js Typical React says that you should place these in separate files and import them into the App.js file.
  - That means I'm doing it wrong. I'm keeping it as it is all in one file because it's easier to see in this project when it comes to figuring out state and props.
  - Don't do it like this in other projects!
