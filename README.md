A tiny CRUD task list - code to help remember Hooks with functional components in React

CRUD = Create, Read, Update, and Delete

## Why

- To practice using Hooks in React

## Notes

- Functional components are cool. useState lets you use state in React without class components!
- I tried using useEffect just to try them out but couldn't figure out a good use for them in this app. I set one up that gives a console.log message when one state changes and then I commented it out. Maybe if I used an API it would be more useful.
